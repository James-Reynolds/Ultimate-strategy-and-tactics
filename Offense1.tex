This document is about 
playing primary 'middle' 
or left wing 
on offence. 
These are
referred to as position O1 here\footnote{This document
is part of a series, 
the rest of which is available here (LINK TO BE PROVIDED}.
\newthought{Your team is starting the point} on offence.
There are three key pieces of information you'll need from your team before the point starts:
1) What everyone's role is? 
(You are O1, 
which makes you a cutter\footnote{  
O2, O3 and O4 are also cutters, and
O5, O6 and O7 are handlers.}.;
2) What offensive structure/plan is your team planning on using?\footnote{
Vertical,
horizontal, 
or something else}
3) What defensive structure/plan to use if there is a turnover? 

What actually happens, 
however, 
is likely to depend more on 
what the opposing team (D1-D7) does. 
After the pull 
as you run downfield\footnote{
In the meantime, 
the handlers on your team 
will be busy 
catching the pull
Figures \ref{fig:O1-vertical} and  \ref{fig:O1-horizontal} 
show O6 starting play 
at the brick mark, 
as might occur if 
the pull is out.} it will help 
if you can figure out 
what defensive structure the D team use.
It might be:
person-match defence;
a zone defence; or
something else
(often called "junk").
What you should do 
in the event of each
is the subject of this document. 


\section{Person-match defence, vertical stack}\label{sec:vertical}
So, if you identify the defensive structure as person-match
the next thing to try and figure out
is what direction the opposition are forcing. 
Forehand force for right handers is the most common, 
so this is discussed first. 

Three throws for O6 
to get the disc 
to you are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item a break-side 
huck to A\footnote{
This throw is 
probably
very difficult for O6 to make. 
However, you as O1
realistically will not have to do much
other than stand still at the starting position
then run and catch it
after O6 has thrown it. 
Figure \ref{fig:O1-vertical} indicates how 
D8 will be on the wrong side of you (as O1)
and so probably won't have much of a play on the disc.};

\item an open-side huck to B\footnote{
This throw is especially viable if: 
D8 is standing further upfield than indicated; 
you (as O1) are faster than D8; or 
D8 does not react to an initial cut downfield (black arrow)}; and 
\item an open-side throw 
to an upfield cut to C\footnote{
The solid black arrows indicate 
a cut you might do as O1:
initially going deep
but then making a back under, 
upfield cut 
on the open side
for Throw C.}.
\end{enumerate}


The space
that you have 
to cut in
is between 
the dashed red 
and dashed yellow lines. 
This is because if you go 
further downfield than the dashed red line 
before O6 throws the discs\footnote{
A, B 
and the dashed red line 
effectively move further upfield
or downfield
if O6 has a shorter or longer huck.},
D8 will be able 
get to
A or B 
well before the disc does, 
and so be able to intercept 
or prevent 
any throws to 
you or others
to A or B. 
Similarly, 
if you go 
upfield of the dashed yellow line
then D8 will be able 
to get involved in 
preventing dump throws from O6
to O5 
or O7.
Hence, as O1 
if you have made it to C
but have not had the disc thrown to you
perhaps it is time to go back to the vertical stack
and make space for someone else to cut
%\footnote{
%O2 will likely be waiting for you (O1) to get out of the way
%so that they can do a similar cut to C, 
%but by then O6 
%may have thrown it to O4,
%or engaged O5 or O7 
%for a dump}. 




If you receive the disc at A or B hopefully it is a goal. 
But if not, the principles that apply 
to receiving the disc at C 
(or elsewhere) likely apply. Figure \ref{fig:O1-vertical2} shows 
the situation if the disc has been thrown to you
on the back-under cut towards C.

\begin{marginfigure}%
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{O1-vertical2}
  \caption{Vertical stack progression}
  \label{fig:O1-vertical2}
\end{marginfigure}





 In Figure \ref{fig:O1-vertical2}\footnote{
Note that A', B', C', and 
the yellow and red dashed lines 
are all now further downfield 
reflecting the new position of the disc.
The stack (O2, O3) 
has also moved downfield} 
your options include:
\begin{enumerate}
\item throwing to A' (to O4 or maybe O2);
\item throwing to O2 going to B' or C'\footnote{
Who should be doing what you did earlier, now that they are 
at the downfield end of the vertical stack.}; 
\item off-load to O6
in power position\footnote{
So called because 
O6 is 
in a powerful position 
where they can easily 
thrown anywhere on the field 
as D13 will likely be lagging.}. 
In contrast, D8 will likely
make it difficult for you (O1) to throw 
to the break side of the field
one of the better things you might do 
is get the disc back to O6\footnote{
A pass to O6 should be relatively easy (as D13 is on the wrong side having been forcing forehand) and will put them in a strong position to throw the next pass. Alternatively, throw a dump to O5}.


\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Horizontal stack}\label{sec:horizontall}
\newthought{Figure \ref{fig:O1-horizontal}}

\begin{marginfigure}%
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{O1-horizontal}
  \caption{Horizontal stack formation}
  \label{fig:O1-horizontal}
\end{marginfigure}



\subsection{Sidenotes}\label{sec:sidenotes}
One of the most prominent and distinctive features of this style is the
extensive use of sidenotes.  There is a wide margin to provide ample room
for sidenotes and small figures.  Any \Verb|\footnote|s will automatically
be converted to sidenotes.\footnote{This is a sidenote that was entered
using the \texttt{\textbackslash footnote} command.}  If you'd like to place ancillary
information in the margin without the sidenote mark (the superscript
number), you can use the \Verb|\marginnote| command.\marginnote{This is a
margin note.  Notice that there isn't a number preceding the note, and
there is no number in the main text where this note was written.}

The specification of the \Verb|\sidenote| command is:
\begin{docspec}
  \doccmd{sidenote[\docopt{number}][\docopt{offset}]\{\docarg{Sidenote text.}\}}
\end{docspec}

Both the \docopt{number} and \docopt{offset} arguments are optional.  If you
provide a \docopt{number} argument, then that number will be used as the
sidenote number.  It will change of the number of the current sidenote only and
will not affect the numbering sequence of subsequent sidenotes.

Sometimes a sidenote may run over the top of other text or graphics in the
margin space.  If this happens, you can adjust the vertical position of the
sidenote by providing a dimension in the \docopt{offset} argument.  Some
examples of valid dimensions are:
\begin{docspec}
  \ttfamily 1.0in \qquad 2.54cm \qquad 254mm \qquad 6\Verb|\baselineskip|
\end{docspec}
If the dimension is positive it will push the sidenote down the page; if the
dimension is negative, it will move the sidenote up the page.

While both the \docopt{number} and \docopt{offset} arguments are optional, they
must be provided in order.  To adjust the vertical position of the sidenote
while leaving the sidenote number alone, use the following syntax:
\begin{docspec}
  \doccmd{sidenote[][\docopt{offset}]\{\docarg{Sidenote text.}\}}
\end{docspec}
The empty brackets tell the \Verb|\sidenote| command to use the default
sidenote number.

If you \emph{only} want to change the sidenote number, however, you may
completely omit the \docopt{offset} argument:
\begin{docspec}
  \doccmd{sidenote[\docopt{number}]\{\docarg{Sidenote text.}\}}
\end{docspec}

The \Verb|\marginnote| command has a similar \docarg{offset} argument:
\begin{docspec}
  \doccmd{marginnote[\docopt{offset}]\{\docarg{Margin note text.}\}}
\end{docspec}

\subsection{References}
References are placed alongside their citations as sidenotes,
as well.  This can be accomplished using the normal \Verb|\cite|
command.\sidenote{The first paragraph of this document includes a citation.}

The complete list of references may also be printed automatically by using
the \Verb|\bibliography| command.  (See the end of this document for an
example.)  If you do not want to print a bibliography at the end of your
document, use the \Verb|\nobibliography| command in its place.  

To enter multiple citations at one location,\cite{Tufte2006,Tufte1990} you can
provide a list of keys separated by commas and the same optional vertical
offset argument: \Verb|\cite{Tufte2006,Tufte1990}|.  
\begin{docspec}
  \doccmd{cite[\docopt{offset}]\{\docarg{bibkey1,bibkey2,\ldots}\}}
\end{docspec}

\section{Figures and Tables}\label{sec:figures-and-tables}
Images and graphics play an integral role in Tufte's work.
In addition to the standard \docenv{figure} and \docenv{tabular} environments,
this style provides special figure and table environments for full-width
floats.

Full page--width figures and tables may be placed in \docenv{figure*} or
\docenv{table*} environments.  To place figures or tables in the margin,
use the \docenv{marginfigure} or \docenv{margintable} environments as follows
(see figure~\ref{fig:marginfig}):

\begin{marginfigure}%
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{helix}
  \caption{This is a margin figure.  The helix is defined by 
    $x = \cos(2\pi z)$, $y = \sin(2\pi z)$, and $z = [0, 2.7]$.  The figure was
    drawn using Asymptote (\url{http://asymptote.sf.net/}).}
  \label{fig:marginfig}
\end{marginfigure}
\begin{Verbatim}
\begin{marginfigure}
  \includegraphics{helix}
  \caption{This is a margin figure.}
\end{marginfigure}
\end{Verbatim}

The \docenv{marginfigure} and \docenv{margintable} environments accept an optional parameter \docopt{offset} that adjusts the vertical position of the figure or table.  See the ``\nameref{sec:sidenotes}'' section above for examples.  The specifications are:
\begin{docspec}
  \doccmd{begin\{marginfigure\}[\docopt{offset}]}\\
  \qquad\ldots\\
  \doccmd{end\{marginfigure\}}\\
  \mbox{}\\
  \doccmd{begin\{margintable\}[\docopt{offset}]}\\
  \qquad\ldots\\
  \doccmd{end\{margintable\}}\\
\end{docspec}

Figure~\ref{fig:fullfig} is an example of the \Verb|figure*|
environment and figure~\ref{fig:textfig} is an example of the normal
\Verb|figure| environment.

\begin{figure*}[h]
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{sine.pdf}%
  \caption{This graph shows $y = \sin x$ from about $x = [-10, 10]$.
  \emph{Notice that this figure takes up the full page width.}}%
  \label{fig:fullfig}%
\end{figure*}

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics{hilbertcurves.pdf}
%  \checkparity This is an \pageparity\ page.%
  \caption{Hilbert curves of various degrees $n$.
  \emph{Notice that this figure only takes up the main textblock width.}}
  \label{fig:textfig}
  %\zsavepos{pos:textfig}
  \setfloatalignment{b}
\end{figure}

Table~\ref{tab:normaltab} shows table created with the \docpkg{booktabs}
package.  Notice the lack of vertical rules---they serve only to clutter
the table's data.

\begin{table}[ht]
  \centering
  \fontfamily{ppl}\selectfont
  \begin{tabular}{ll}
    \toprule
    Margin & Length \\
    \midrule
    Paper width & \unit[8\nicefrac{1}{2}]{inches} \\
    Paper height & \unit[11]{inches} \\
    Textblock width & \unit[6\nicefrac{1}{2}]{inches} \\
    Textblock/sidenote gutter & \unit[\nicefrac{3}{8}]{inches} \\
    Sidenote width & \unit[2]{inches} \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Here are the dimensions of the various margins used in the Tufte-handout class.}
  \label{tab:normaltab}
  %\zsavepos{pos:normaltab}
\end{table}

\section{Full-width text blocks}

In addition to the new float types, there is a \docenv{fullwidth}
environment that stretches across the main text block and the sidenotes
area.

\begin{Verbatim}
\begin{fullwidth}
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...
\end{fullwidth}
\end{Verbatim}

\begin{fullwidth}
\small\itshape\lipsum[1]
\end{fullwidth}

\section{Typography}\label{sec:typography}

\subsection{Typefaces}\label{sec:typefaces}
If the Palatino, \textsf{Helvetica}, and \texttt{Bera Mono} typefaces are installed, this style
will use them automatically.  Otherwise, we'll fall back on the Computer Modern
typefaces.

\subsection{Letterspacing}\label{sec:letterspacing}
This document class includes two new commands and some improvements on
existing commands for letterspacing.

When setting strings of \allcaps{ALL CAPS} or \smallcaps{small caps}, the
letter\-spacing---that is, the spacing between the letters---should be
increased slightly.\cite{Bringhurst2005}  The \Verb|\allcaps| command has proper letterspacing for
strings of \allcaps{FULL CAPITAL LETTERS}, and the \Verb|\smallcaps| command
has letterspacing for \smallcaps{small capital letters}.  These commands
will also automatically convert the case of the text to upper- or
lowercase, respectively.

The \Verb|\textsc| command has also been redefined to include
letterspacing.  The case of the \Verb|\textsc| argument is left as is,
however.  This allows one to use both uppercase and lowercase letters:
\textsc{The Initial Letters Of The Words In This Sentence Are Capitalized.}
